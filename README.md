| hygrometer.csv | IoT hygrometer data | Willie Wheeler | Data collected from a Raspberry Pi hygrometer I built - see [my blog post](https://medium.com/wwblog/connecting-a-raspberry-pi-based-hygrometer-to-azure-iot-central-6e1a00a14639). The first hour of data is missing. The obvious anomalies at night on 11/12 are misreads that happened when I put the device in sleep mode. Our thermostat kicks on at 7:00 AM on weekdays and 8:00 AM on weekends, which you can see in the data. Also 11/13 and 11/14 were cold, whereas 11/15 was not, so you can see that too. |
